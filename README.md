# 📘 Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio!

This repository highlights a selection of my work across system design, social robotics research, HCI, and applied software engineering. Each project reflects my interest in building thoughtful, user-centered systems — whether through research, automation, or full-stack development.

# 🧠 Comparative analysis of perceptions of autistic traits in Human and Robotic agents
**[Paper](https://github.com/Sabrina459/My-projects/blob/main/Social%20Robotics%20Research.pdf)**

**Type:** Academic Research

**Focus:** Human–Robot Interaction, Social Robotics, Assistive Robotics

- Investigated how people interact with socially assistive robots and how design, behavior cues, and modality impact trust and engagement.

- Conducted user studies, data analysis, and prototyping of interaction scenarios.

- Informed design guidelines for more empathetic and accessible robot behaviors.

# 🎓  Investigating the gap between research and practice in Robot-Based therapy for Autism Spectrum Disorder
**[Thesis](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/6efd1ff3-03d0-477f-a646-fd7e1db2966d)**

**Type:** Master’s Thesis 

**Topic:** Accessible Information Systems for Cancer Patients

- Designed and evaluated an app that supports cancer patients with clear, empathetic, and accessible information.

- Led UX research, wireframing, prototyping, and iterative testing with real users.

- Developed recommendations for designing healthcare information tools that prioritize emotional and cognitive accessibility.

# 🛠️ CV Generator
**[Master Repository](https://github.com/Sabrina459/CVGenerator)**

**Type:** Personal Project

**Stack:** Python, spaCy, Transformers, OpenAI API

- Built an automated CV customization tool that parses job descriptions, matches relevant experience, and fills a structured template.

- Includes NLP-based relevance scoring and a flexible template fill engine.

- Supports DOCX output with preserved formatting.

# 📄 CSV Parsing & Automation System
**[Master Repository](https://github.com/Sabrina459/DataExtraction-Platform)**

**Type:** Personal Project

**Stack:** JavaScript, Node.js, Chrome Extension, REST API, Google Cloud Run

- Developed a parsing system for extracting structured data from e-commerce websites.

- Early version works as a Chrome extension with hard-coded site profiles calling my API hosted on Google Cloud Run.

- Currently expanding it into a scalable, multi-user platform with OAuth-based authentication.

# 🏆 Hackathon: AI-portal for cancer patient education - System Design Poster
**[Poster](https://github.com/Sabrina459/Velocity-Hack2025)**

**Type:** Hackathon Project

**Focus:** System Architecture, Scalability, Cloud Services

- Created a system design blueprint for a distributed, real-time application.

- Documented architecture components, data flow, scaling strategies, and failure handling.

- Communicated the design visually through a clear, competition-ready poster.
